This is a good rope. I have been jump rope training for the better part of 20 years and have used every kind of rope imaginable, and I really like this one. First of all, it's a right angle-cable rope; common design for speed ropes. Great for speed skipping, double unders, triples, etc. These ropes are typically NOT great for variations like cross overs, side swings, etc. because the cables kink and bind at the handle. I was pleasantly surprised that this one doesn't do that. The grade of cable is just soft enough to allow some variations of hand position. The screw adjustment system works well and the handle design is good with the flange at the end, although I'd prefer a handle that's about 1" longer. All in all, a very good rope for it's purpose. I have this one in my gym bag along with two Buddy Lee Ropes (Areo Speed and Rope Master), a Jumpnrope.com R1 speed rope, and a basic beaded rope and for speed training, this is my go-to rope. And for the price, it's probably the best value on Amazon. I have attached a video review for anyone interested, and I recently used this rope to hit two PRs... max double unders in a minute at 130, and unbroken double unders at 210. Good product; happy to support it.
